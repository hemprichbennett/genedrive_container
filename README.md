Quick example repo running Ace and Sara's code from https://github.com/AceRNorth/GeneralMetapop, using 2 scripts: 
- image_build.sh creates a fresh docker image (dockerhub username would need editing for anyone other than me, 'hemprichbennett'), using the instructions written in the DOCKERFILE, tagging it with the date of creation. This image contains an ubuntu operating system with the GeneralMetapop app installed in the root directory. The script then then pushes this image to dockerhub at https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/hemprichbennett/genedrive_img/general.
- container_terminal.sh pulls the image from dockerhub tagged as being created on 2024-06-11 (unless it's already cached locally), then runs it as a container, running the executable file. As there are no directories mounted in this quick script, it'll run the app but no outputs will be saved to the host machine, so this is only really useful for an example. Anyone running this script would want to modify it using the `-v` flag once or more, so that a volume (directory) from their machine is mounted to a desired location inside the container to provide input files to the program, and retain the output files once the container finishes running. This command can also be modified by replacing the `/GeneralMetapop/build/gdsimsapp` command at the end of the script with `bash`, which will allow the user to enter the container itself with an interactive bash terminal. They can then explore, run the app, etc.
